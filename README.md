Expense app
---

This simple expense-tracking app started out as an example app for a blog post on <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_new">D3</a>+ 
<a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_new">React</a>+ 
<a href="http://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html" target="_new">Flux</a>.  
The blog post itself has yet to be written (I got carried away), but you can find the <a href="https://sxywu.github.io/expenses" target="_new">app here</a>.

**Next steps**  
* Set up a node server and store data in database
* Hook up <a href="https://plaid.com/" target="_new">Plaid</a> API, import credit card transactions (manual input?  Ain't nobody got time for that)
* Better mobile compatibility
* Better design and styling
